export { default as theme } from './theme'

# Hello!
This is my first slide 😎

---

And this is my second 😝

---

Code samples show up just fine:

``` jsx
<Button type={primary}>
  Click me!
</Button>
```

---

import Counter from './components/Counter'

You can even import React components directly:

<Counter />

---

Sweet as 🎉
